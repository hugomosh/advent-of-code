# Advent of code

Advent of Code featuring Hugo Mosh

## Intro

I am going to solve the Aoc using TS. Ideally I want to do them in Rust or Dart to learn more about this languages. But time is running out for 2021 so I am going to go with TS first.

## Read files

From [tatupesonen/aoc-typescript-starter: Starter for TypeScript projects. Provides automatic input fetching & creating from a template.](https://github.com/tatupesonen/aoc-typescript-starter)

```sh
npm start create 2020 1

```

## Run the code

```sh
npm start run 2020 1
```


For rust 

```sh

# Live watch with cargo-watch `cargo install cargo-watch`
cargo watch -x 'run'

# Live watch with nodemon `npm i -g nodemon`
nodemon --watch src -e rs --exec cargo run --release
```
